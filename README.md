# Micro-doppler-based-target-classification
Micro-Doppler–based target classification uses radar to identify objects by analyzing tiny motion-induced frequency shifts, such as limb swings or rotor spins. These unique time–frequency signatures enable machine learning to distinguish humans, animals, vehicles, or drones, even in low-visibility conditions.
